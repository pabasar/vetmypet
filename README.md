# Vet My Pet
### Wearable device and mobile application to for dog disease diagnosis. 

Unlike human beings, dogs are not able to express the physical disorders or sicknesses that they are suffering with. Instead, they show some common behavioral changes such as, food avoiding, vomiting, acting dull, being aggressive, shivering and etc. But these common behavioral changes are insufficient for accurate diagnosis of diseases. To help with pre-identification and better diagnose, the “Vet My Pet” app has been developed with a wearable device that takes health measurements of dogs, processes and visualizes the data to help veterinary surgeons to make better judgments. The product will be useful in minimizing the spread of dog diseases and preventing other health problems among dogs.

To transfer health data from device to mobile phone flutter-blutooth-serial codings were used https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bluetooth_serial.
